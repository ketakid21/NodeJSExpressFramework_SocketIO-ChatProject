    For clients (or browsers) to be able to connect to the server, they must use the client side javascript library
    that ships with Socket IO and then connect to the server. Server is serving single index.html file and this needs
    to be connected to the server. This can be achieved by adding following lines. This includes a single javascript file that
    allows the client (or browser) to communicate with the server. This can be any server but in this case it is connected to Node JS
    server running on 127.0.0.1 on port 3000
  script(src='/socket.io/socket.io.js')
  script.
    var socket = io.connect('http://127.0.0.1:3000');
